<p align="center">A mod to make your nights longer than ever. </p>

## Features
Disables sleeping in beds, making it necessary to figure out what to do with your time; go mining or explore the world during night, I promise, it's more fun!
Since beds are disabled, the phantom spawn rate has been decreased by 80%, no need to worry about having to deal with phantoms each and every night.
